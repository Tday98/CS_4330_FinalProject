# Swift Comparison done by Tristan Day

## Language Purpose/Genesis

Swift was designed around using Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the already in existence Obj-C code.

Swift addressed some common programming issues such as null pointers and it provided syntactic sugar to avoid the pyramid of doom

Swift is mainly a replacement to Apple's previous Objective-C code.

## Unique Features

Swift has unique features such as Optionals and multiple return values

Other features are Closures, generics, structs that support methods, extensions and protocols, and Functional programming patterns.

## Namespaces


Namespaces are per-target.

Chris Lattner stated, "Namespacing is implicit in Swift, all classes (etc) are scoped by the module (XCode Target) they are in. No class prefixes needed"

[EXAMPLE](Swift/namespace.playground)

## Types

Swift supports all basic types and multiple other types such as structs, enums, and classes

Reference types such as a class are supported and so are value types such as structs, enums, and tuples.

New value types can be created in swift

## Classes
